= Data Structures

[abstract]
You can use complex data structures such as dictionaries and lists in Couchbase.
These data structures may be manipulated with basic operations without retrieving and storing the entire document.

Data structures in Couchbase are similar in concept to data structures in the Java Collections Framework:

* *Map* is like PHP `array`, where a value is accessed by using a key string.
* *List* is like a PHP `array` and is a sequential data structure.
Values can be placed in the beginning or end of a list, and can be accessed using numeric indexes.
* *Queue* is a wrapper over a _list_ which offers FIFO (first-in-first-out) semantics, allowing it to be used as a lightweight job queue.
* *Set* is a wrapper over a _list_ which provides the ability to handle unique values.

These data structures as implemented in other SDKs are stored as JSON documents in Couchbase, and can therefore be accessed using N1QL, Full Text Search, and normal key-value operations.
Data structures can also be manipulated using the traditional sub-document and full-document KV APIs.

Using the data structures API may help your application in two ways:

* *Simplicity*: Data structures provide high level operations by which you can deal with documents as if they were container data structures.
Adding an item to a dictionary is expressed as `mapAdd`, rather than retrieving the entire document, modifying it locally, and then saving it back to the server.
* *Efficiency*: Data structure operations do not transfer the entire document across the network.
Only the relevant data is exchanged between client and server, allowing for less network overhead and lower latency.

== Creating a Data Structure

Data structures are created implicitly if they do not exist.
For example, to add an item to a map, specify the _document ID_ of the map itself (i.e.
the ID which uniquely identifies the map in the server), the key _within_ the map, and the value to store under the key:

[source,php]
----
$bucket->mapAdd("map_id", "name", "Mark Nunberg");
----

Likewise, to create a list, specify the document ID and the value to add:

[source,php]
----
$bucket->listPush("list_id", "hello");
----

Note that if the document already exists it will not be overwritten, more elements will be pushed to the list.
It is therefore always safe to use, unless your application creates data structures independently.

Data structures can be explicitly created and reset using full-document methods, and initialize it with its JSON equivalent.
To create a new empty list, set, or queue, use

[source,php]
----
$bucket->insert("list_id", []);
----

To create an empty map, use

[source,php]
----
$bucket->insert("map_id", new stdclass());
----

Note, that to create proper empty JSON object we use `new stdclass()`, it is not necessary if your _empty_ object have some fields, (e.g.
`+["type" => "person"]+`).

== Accessing Data Structures

Data structures can be accessed using the appropriate methods.
Most data access methods will return a [.api]`CouchbaseMetaDoc` object with actual returned value in [.var]`value` property.

[source,php]
----
$bucket->listGet("list_id")->value;    // "hello"
$bucket->mapGet("map_id")->value;      // "mark nunberg"
----

The same subdocument exceptions are forwarded on the datastructures API like if map key or list index is not found within the document.

Here is a list of common operations:

.Data Structure Operations
[cols="25,94"]
|===
| Operation | Description

| [.api]`mapAdd`
a|
Add a key to the map.

[source,php]
----
$bucket->mapAdd("map_id", "some_key", "value")
----

| [.api]`mapRemove`
a|
Remove a key from a map.

[source,php]
----
$bucket->mapRemove("map_id", "some_key")
----

| [.api]`mapGet`
a|
Get an item from a map.

[source,php]
----
$bucket->mapGet("map_id", "some_key")->value
----

If the key is not found, an exception with code [.api]`COUCHBASE_SUBDOC_PATH_ENOENT` is raised.

| [.api]`listPush`
a|
Add an item to the _end_ of a list.

[source,php]
----
$bucket->listPush("list_id", 1234)
----

| [.api]`listShift`
a|
Add an item to the _beginning_ of a list.

[source,php]
----
$bucket->listShift("list_id", "hello world")
----

| [.api]`listRemove`
a|
Remove a value from a list.

[source,php]
----
$bucket->listRemove("list_id", 2)
----

| [.api]`listSet`
a|
Set an element at a specific index in the list.

[source,php]
----
$bucket->listSet("list_id", 0, "first value")
----

| [.api]`listGet`
a|
Get an item from a list by its index.

[source,php]
----
$bucket->listGet("list_id", 0)->value
----

If the index is out of range, an exception with code [.api]`COUCHBASE_SUBDOC_PATH_ENOENT` will be thrown.
Note that you can get the _last_ array element by specifying `-1` as the index.

| [.api]`setAdd`
a|
Add an item to a set, if the item does not yet exist in the set.

[source,php]
----
$bucket->setAdd("set_id", "some_value")
----

Note that a _set_ is just a list.
You can retrieve the entire set by simply using a full-document [.api]`get` operation:

[source,php]
----
$set = $bucket->get("set_id")->value
----

NOTE: Currently, you can only store primitive values in sets, such as strings, ints, and booleans.

| [.api]`setExists`
a|
Check if a value exists in the set.

[source,php]
----
$bucket->setExists("set_id", "value")
----

| [.api]`setRemove`
a|
Remove an item from a set, if it exists.
An exception is not thrown if the item does not exist.
You can determine if an item existed or not by the return value.
If the item did not exist beforehand, `NULL` is returned.

[source,php]
----
$bucket->setRemove("set_id", "some_value")
----

| [.api]`queueAdd`
a|
Add an item to the beginning of the queue.

[source,php]
----
$bucket->queueAdd("a_queue", "job123")
----

Note that a queue is just a list.
You can retrieve items from the middle of the queue by using [.api]`listGet`.

| [.api]`queueRemove`
a|
Remove an item from the end queue and return it.

[source,php]
----
item = $bucket->queueRemove("a_queue") //=> "job123"
----

If the queue is empty, then [.api]`NULL` is returned.

| [.api]`mapSize`, [.api]`listSize`, [.api]`setSize`, [.api]`queueSize`
a|
These methods get the length of the data structure.
For maps, this is the number of key-value pairs inside the map.
For lists, queues, and sets, this is the number of elements in the structure.

[source,php]
----
$len = $bucket->listSize("a_list") //=> 42
----
|===

Note that there are only *two* basic types: map and list.
Types such as _queue_ and _set_ are merely derivatives of _list_.

== Data Structures and Key-Value APIs

Data structures can be accessed using key-value APIs as well.
In fact, the data structure API is actually a client-side wrapper _around_ the key-value and sub-document API.
Most of the data structure APIs wrap the sub-document API directly.
Therefore, for example, the [.api]`mapSet` can be implemented as follows:

[source,php]
----
function mapSet($bucket, $docid, $key, $value) {
            return $bucket->mutateIn($docid)
                          ->upsert($key, $value)->execute();
}
----

Some data structure operations are compound operations.
This means that they do not correspond to a single server-side operation.
For example, [.api]`setRemove` does not exist on the server.
In order to implement [.api]`setRemove`, it would require an implementation like so:

[source,php]
----
function setRemove($bucket, $docid, $value) {
    $rv = $bucket->get($docid);
    $doc = $rv->value;
    $index = array_search($value, $doc);
    return $bucket->mutateIn($docid, $rv->cas)
                  ->remove("[$index]")->execute();
}
----

In the example above, the entire document is fetched and the index of the value is retrieved.
If the value exists, the index of the value is removed at the server side.

NOTE: Because the data structure API is just a wrapper around the various key-value APIs, you are free to switch between them in your code.
