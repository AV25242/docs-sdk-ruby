= PHP Sample App Backend Tutorial
:navtitle: Sample App Backend

[abstract]
The PHP SDK tutorial bridges the gap between simple and advanced concepts, by walking through a complete web application.

The source code for the tutorial is available on GitHub, at https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-php/tree/server-5.0[couchbaselabs/try-cb-php^].
The primary focus of the tutorial is to explain the function and theory behind the Couchbase PHP client, and how it works together with Couchbase Server; with special reference to features such as `N1QL`, `FTS` and `sub-document`.
It makes use of the `travel-sample` data set.
The code that generates the web application is provided with the source code, but is not discussed in this tutorial.

== Specific PHP Prerequisites and Set-Up

Before attempting to install the sample-app backend, install the Couchbase PHP SDK, as explained in xref:start-using-sdk.adoc[Start Using the SDK]

Then, proceed as follows:

* Make sure your system is running the 5.0 version of Couchbase Server.
The server must have the `travel-sample` bucket installed, and an index named `hotel` defined on `travel-sample`.
A user with username `travel-sample` and password `travel-sample` should also be defined, with the `Bucket Full Access` and `Bucket Admin` roles assigned for the `travel-sample` bucket.
+
For information on installing Couchbase Server, see xref:6.0@server:install:install-intro.adoc[Installing Couchbase Server].
For information on initializing and configuring, see xref:6.0@server:install:init-setup.adoc[Initialize the Cluster].
Sample buckets, and your means of installing them, are described in xref:6.0@server:settings:install-sample-buckets.adoc[Sample Buckets].
The process whereby users, credentials, and roles are defined by means of the Couchbase Web Console is explained in xref:6.0@server:security:security-rbac-for-admins-and-apps.adoc[Creating and Managing Users with the UI].

* Clone the source for the application, and checkout the 5.0 version:
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-php.git
cd try-cb-php
git checkout server-5.0
----

* Make sure `composer` is installed, then use it to install the application:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
composer install
----

* Create an `.env` file as follows:
+
[source,bash]
----
cp .env.example .env
----
+
Then, bring up `.env` in an editor, and establish username and password values as follows:
+
[source,bash]
----
DB_USERNAME=travel-sample
DB_PASSWORD=travel-sample
----

* Generate a key, for accessing the application:
+
[source,bash]
----
php artisan key:generate
----

* Run the application:
+
[source,bash]
----
php artisan serve --port 8080
----

== Connecting to the Cluster and Getting a Bucket

Initially, the application must connect to the Couchbase cluster.
The set-up information for this activity is provided in https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-php/blob/master/config/database.php[try-cb-php/config/database.php^].
This file includes definitions of the IP address of the cluster, and the credentials used by the applications for server-access:

[source,php]
----
'couchbase' => [
'driver'        => 'couchbase',
'host'          => 'couchbase://' . env('COUCHBASE_SERVER', '127.0.0.1'),
'user'          => env('COUCHBASE_USER', 'Administrator'),
'password'      => env('COUCHBASE_PASS', 'password'),
],
----

Note that detailed information on connection-management via the Couchbase PHP SDK can be found in xref:managing-connections.adoc[Managing Connections].

On connection to the cluster, a specific bucket must be opened.
The bucket used by the application is `travel-sample`.
Once the bucket is opened, queries can be performed on the data it contains.
The code for cluster-connection and bucket-access is provided in https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-php/blob/95152187b98e97cc0f3f70885d41b8c6bc9f54a5/app/Http/Controllers/CouchbaseController.php[try-cb-php/app/Http/Controllers/CouchbaseController.php^]:

[source,php]
----
$this->db = DB::connection('couchbase')->openBucket('travel-sample');
----

Note that a detailed functional description of buckets is provided in xref:6.0@server:understanding-couchbase:buckets-memory-and-storage/buckets.adoc[Buckets].

== Manage Users

The application creates and authenticates users, and allows them to make bookings.
The code is provided in https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-php/blob/3d9975861b417ce53e051d57fa10388963d47798/app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php[try-cb-php/app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php^].
Users are created and stored as follows:

[source,php]
----
public function create(Request $request)
{
  $credentials = [
    'name' => $request->user,
    'password' => $request->password,
  ];
  $user = new User($credentials);
  try {
    $this->db->insert("user::".$request->user, $user);
    return response()->json(["data" => ["token" => $this->buildToken($user)]]);
  } catch (\Couchbase\Exception $ex) {
      return response()->json(["failure" => 'Failed to create user'], 409);
  }
}
----

The full range of user-management features supported by the Couchbase PHP SDK is provided in xref:sdk-user-management-overview.adoc[User Management].

== Simple N1QL Queries: Finding Airports

The application queries Couchbase Server by means of the *N1QL* language.
Simple N1QL queries, for finding airports, are demonstrated in https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-php/blob/3d9975861b417ce53e051d57fa10388963d47798/app/Http/Controllers/AirportController.php[try-cb-php/app/Http/Controllers/AirportController.php^].
The following code-excerpt shows how a maximum of five results are returned, where the airport-name corresponds to that provided by means of a parameter whose value is user-specified:

[source,php]
----
$query = \CouchbaseN1qlQuery::fromString('SELECT airportname FROM `travel-sample` WHERE faa like $faa limit 5');
$query->namedParams(['faa' => $searchStr]);
----

An introduction to querying with N1QL is provided in xref:n1ql-query.adoc[Querying with N1QL].
Additional information can be found in xref:n1ql-queries-with-sdk.adoc[N1QL from the SDKs].

== Complex N1QL Queries: Finding Routes

More complex N1QL queries are used to return flight paths between airports: the code is provided in https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-php/blob/3d9975861b417ce53e051d57fa10388963d47798/app/Http/Controllers/FlightPathsController.php[try-cb-php/app/Http/Controllers/FlightPathsController.php^].
The following example returns airports each of which is both an origin and a destination:

[source,php]
----
public function find(Request $request, $from, $to)
{
  $qs1 = \CouchbaseN1qlQuery::fromString('
    SELECT faa AS fromAirport  FROM `travel-sample`
    WHERE airportname = $from UNION
    SELECT faa AS toAirport FROM `travel-sample`
    WHERE airportname = $to
  ');
  $qs1->namedParams(['from' => $from, 'to' => $to]);
  $result = $this->db->query($qs1);
----

== Full Text Search: Finding Hotels

The Couchbase *Full Text Search* facility is used by the application, to return hotels.
The code is provided in https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-php/blob/master/app/Http/Controllers/HotelController.php[try-cb-php/app/Http/Controllers/HotelController.php^].
The following excerpt shows how a user-specified location is attemptedly matched with text-values provided in multiple location-fields in documents within the `travel-sample` bucket:

[source,php]
----
$queryBody = SearchQuery::conjuncts(SearchQuery::term("hotel")->field("type"));
if (!empty($location) && $location != "*") {
  $queryBody->every(SearchQuery::disjuncts(
    SearchQuery::match($location)->field("country"),
    SearchQuery::match($location)->field("city"),
    SearchQuery::match($location)->field("state"),
    SearchQuery::match($location)->field("address")
  ));
}
----
