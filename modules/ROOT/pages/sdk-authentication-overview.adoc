= Authentication

[abstract]
RBAC requires that users pass appropriate _credentials_ to Couchbase Server in order to access
cluster-resources.The SDK provides enhanced support for the passing of credentials.

== Passing Credentials

Ruby SDK 2.x does not support authenticator entities, but still support RBAC-enabled
servers. Credentials have to be passed with `:username` and `:password` options to
`Couchbase::Bucket` constructor or `Couchbase.connect` method.

[code,ruby]
----
Couchbase.connect('couchbase://localhost/bucketname',
                  :username => 'Administrator',
                  :password => 'secret')
----

== Further Information on RBAC

All aspects of the Couchbase RBAC system are covered in the section xref:6.0@server:security:security-authorization.adoc[Authorization].
Specifically, for information on:

* Adding _Users_ and assigning _roles_, by means of the Couchbase Web Console, see
  xref:6.0@server:security:security-rbac-for-admins-and-apps.adoc[Creating and Managing Users with
  the UI].
* _Roles_ required for resource-access, and the privileges they entail, see
  xref:6.0@server:security:concepts-rba-for-apps.adoc[RBAC for Applications].
* _Resources_ controlled by Couchbase RBAC, see
  xref:6.0@server:security:security-resources-under-access-control.adoc[Resources Under Access
  Control].

== Certificate-Based Authentication

Couchbase Server supports the use of X.509 certificates to authenticate clients.  This allows
authenticated users to access specific resources by means of the data service (no other service is
currently available to clients through this form of authentication).

The process relies on a certificate authority, for the issuing of certificates that validate
identities.  A certificate includes information such as the name of the entity it identifies, an
expiration date, the name of the authority that issued the certificate, and the digital signature of
the authority.  A client attempting to access Couchbase Server can present a certificate to the
server, allowing the server to check the validity of the certificate.  If the certificate is valid,
the user under whose identity the client is running, and the roles assigned that user, are verified.
If the assigned roles are appropriate for the level of access requested to the specified resource,
access is granted.

The Ruby SDK has supported working with X.509 certificates through libcouchbase 2.8.4+. Version
2.8.5 of libcouchbase added the ability for the SSL trust store to be kept in a separate file. The
trust store has to be specified with option `truststorepath=â€¦`, otherwise the library will expect it
to be stored with the certificate in `certpath=`, and the trust store and certificate concatenated
in the certpath.

This shell script will generate the client certificate - you will need to ensure that you have
https://www.openssl.org[OpenSSL^] installed on your system:

----
export CB_ROOT=/opt/couchbase

export TOPDIR=SSLCA
export ROOT_DIR=rootdir
export CLIENT_DIR=clientdir
export INT_DIR=intdir
export ROOT_CA=ca
export INTERMEDIATE=int
export CLIENT=client
export CHAIN=chain

export ADMINCRED=Administrator:password
export ip=127.0.0.1
export USERNAME=testuser

cd ${TOPDIR}

mkdir -p ${CLIENT_DIR}

cd ${CLIENT_DIR}
openssl genrsa -out ${CLIENT}.key 2048
openssl req -new -key ${CLIENT}.key -out ${CLIENT}.csr -subj "/CN=${USERNAME}/OU=None/O=None/L=None/S=None/C=US"
openssl x509 -req -in ${CLIENT}.csr -CA ../${INT_DIR}/${INTERMEDIATE}.pem \
  -CAkey ../${INT_DIR}/${INTERMEDIATE}.key -CAcreateserial \
  -CAserial ../${INT_DIR}/intermediateCA.srl -out ${CLIENT}.pem -days 365

cat ./${CLIENT}.pem ../${INT_DIR}/${INTERMEDIATE}.pem ../${ROOT_DIR}/${ROOT_CA}.pem > ./${CHAIN}.pem
----

Which is then used by passing `+${CLIENT_DIR}/${CHAIN}.pem+` as the `certpath` option, and
`+${CLIENT_DIR}/${CLIENT}.key+` as `keypath` in the connection string (and don't forget
couchbase**s** or http**s** in the schema).  For example:

[code,ruby]
----
Couchbase.connect('couchbases://localhost/bucketname?certpath=/path/to/chain.pem&keypath=/path/to/client.key')
----

When necessary the root certificate, along with all intermediates, might be supplied with a separate
connection string option `truststorepath`, and in this case concatenation (the last step in
certification generation) is not necessary, and the client certificate could be specified as is.
