= Managing Connections Using the PHP SDK with Couchbase Server
:navtitle: Managing Connections

[abstract]
This section describes how to connect the PHP SDK to a Couchbase cluster and bucket.
It contains best practices as well as information on the connection string, SSL and other advanced connection options.

To manage Couchbase Server connections, you need to configure the client, connect to a bucket, and configure SSL.

== Configuring the Client

To configure the client, instantiate a new `Cluster` object:

[source,php]
----
$myCluster = new CouchbaseCluster('couchbase://10.4.4.1,10.4.4.2,10.4.4.3');
----

In addition to the connection string passed to the `Cluster` object, you can include a username and password.
The username and password are required to perform management operations against your cluster.
If you do not use the cluster management aspects of the SDK, the username and password parameters are optional.
Keep in mind that these credentials are the same ones you use to log in to the Couchbase administrator console, not those specified for the bucket itself.

== Authentication

Regular authentication is where you provide a password to the `openBucket()` and `manager()` methods.
It is also possible to define all credentials in single place, and associate with a container, which can be used for all future connections.

Since version 2.3.0, the PHP SDK provides the interface `\Couchbase\Authenticator` which is implemented by all credentials containers.
The library can pull authentication parameters from it when necessary.
At the moment there is only one implementation of this interface: `\Couchbase\ClassicAuthenticator`, but upcoming releases will also have RBAC support.
The use of the authenticator is simple:

[source,php]
----
$authenticator = new \Couchbase\ClassicAuthenticator();
$authenticator->cluster('Administrator', 'password');
$authenticator->bucket('protected', 'secret');

$cluster = new \Couchbase\Cluster("couchbase://localhost");
$cluster->authenticate($authenticator);

$cluster->openBucket('protected'); // successfully opens connection
$cluster->manager()->createBucket('hello'); // automatically use admin credentials
----

It is still possible to provide a password to the `openBucket()` or `manager()` method, which will take precedence over the authenticator.
Such behaviour is discouraged, and future implementations of the `\Couchbase\Authenticator` interface are likely to prevent mixing of authentication sources.

You can shortcut using the `authenticator()` method, if you don't need to reuse the credentials in several instances of `authenticate()`, replacing it with `authenticateAs()`:

[source,php]
----
$cluster = new CouchbaseCluster("couchbase://localhost");
$cluster->authenticateAs('Administrator', 'password');
----

== Connecting to a Bucket

To connect to a bucket, call the `openBucket()` method against your `Cluster` instance, passing in the name of the bucket that you want to connect to.
If no bucket name is specified, the default bucket is opened.
The following example shows how to connect to a bucket:

[source,php]
----
$myCluster = new CouchbaseCluster();
$myBucket = $myCluster->openBucket('default');
----

In addition to the bucket name, you can optionally include the bucket password if one has been defined, as shown in the following example:

[source,php]
----
$myCluster = new CouchbaseCluster();
$myBucket = $myCluster->openBucket('default', 'password');
----

== Disconnecting from a Bucket

To close the connection to a bucket, call its `disconnect()` method.
This method queues the disconnection of all open connections and causes any pending operations to fail.

== Scalability and concurrency

Creating a new [.api]`Bucket` object is relatively expensive, and keeping many idle [.api]`Bucket` objects will negatively impact server performance (if done at a large scale).

PHP SDK by default uses persistent connections to reuse underlying IO objects if the connection strings are the same.
