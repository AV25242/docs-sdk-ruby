= CRUD Document Operations Using the PHP SDK with Couchbase Server
:navtitle: Document Operations

[#operationbasics]
== Operation Basics

Operations use basic PHP data types and most of the PHP data types that can be serialized via the JSON functions are supported by default.
Recursive structures cannot be serialized.
You may alternatively implement your own transcoders which modify the method by which your documents are serialized to Couchbase.
See xref:nonjson.adoc#transcoders[Transcoders] for more details.

If an operation is successful, it will return [.api]`CouchbaseMetaDoc` that contains the [.var]`value` of the document (if returned by operation) as well as the xref:concurrent-mutations-cluster.adoc[[.var]`cas`] value.
If an operation fails, a [.api]`CouchbaseException` is thrown, which may then be caught.

[#creatingdocuments]
== Creating and Updating Full Documents

You can create documents by using the [.api]`insert()` or [.api]`upsert()` methods and update them using the [.api]`replace()` method.
See xref:core-operations.adoc#crud-overview[Primitive Key-Value Operations] for more details.

The following example shows how to create a new document with the `insert()` method:

[source,php]
----
$res = $myBucket->insert('document_name', array('some'=>'value'));
----

You can specify additional options as a third argument to the [.api]`insert`, [.api]`upsert`, and [.api]`replace` functions.
The options are specified as an associative array:

[source,php]
----
$bucket->upsert($key, $doc, array("expiry" => 300));
----

Allowed options are:

* [.param]`cas`: The CAS value for the document.
If the CAS on the server does not match the CAS supplied to the method, the operation will fail with a [.api]`CouchbaseException` with a code of [.api]`COUCHBASE_KEY_EEXISTS` error.
See xref:concurrent-mutations-cluster.adoc[Concurrent Document Mutations] for more information on using the CAS values.
Keep in mind that this case applies only to [.api]`replace()`
* [.param]`expiry`: Specifies the expiry time for the document.
If specified, the document will expire and no longer exist after the given number of seconds.
See xref:core-operations.adoc#expiry[Expiration Overview] for more information.
* [.param]`persist_to`, [.param]`replicate_to`: Specifies xref:durability.adoc[durability requirements] for the operations.

== Retrieving Documents

You can retrieve documents by using the `get()` method.

[source,php]
----
var_dump($bucket->get("new_document"));
----

Sample output from the example is as follows:

....
object(CouchbaseMetaDoc)#6 (4) {
  ["error"]=>
  NULL
  ["value"]=>
  object(stdClass)#5 (1) {
    ["foo"]=>
    string(3) "bar"
  }
  ["flags"]=>
  int(33554438)
  ["cas"]=>
  string(9) "eh5m98g0k"
}
....

The [.api]`get()` method returns a [.api]`CouchbaseMetaDoc` object.
To get the actual value, use the object's [.api]`value` property.
The xref:concurrent-mutations-cluster.adoc[CAS value] is encoded as a string and accessible through [.api]`cas` property.

NOTE: Items stored as associative arrays (such as `+$bucket->upsert(docid, array("prop1" => "value1"))+` are retrieved as PHP [.api]`stdObject` objects; you must reference fields using `+$result->value->property+` rather than `+$result->value["property"]+`

In some instances you may wish to read from a replica node when the xref:failure-considerations.adoc[active node is unavailable].
This can be done using the [.api]`getFromReplica()`.

== Removing Documents

You can delete documents by using the [.api]`remove()` method.

[source,php]
----
$bucket->remove('document_name');
----

You may pass a second argument containing options to the [.api]`remove()` method.
This is passed as an array with the option name as the key and the option value as the array value.
Recognized options are:

* [.param]`cas`: Specify the xref:concurrent-mutations-cluster.adoc[CAS value] to use.
This will ensure that the document is not removed if the CAS value differs.
You may obtain the CAS value from [.api]`CouchbaseMetaDoc::cas`, as a return value of a successful operation.
* [.param]`persist_to`, [.param]`replicate_to`: Specify xref:durability.adoc[durability requirements].
In this case, the SDK will check that the items have been properly _deleted_ from the replicas.

== Modifying the Expiration

Setting xref:core-operations.adoc#expiry[Document expiration] can be performed using the [.api]`touch()` and [.api]`getAndTouch` methods.
These methods accept an expiry value as their second parameter:

[source,php]
----
$cb->upsert('expires', "i'm getting old...", array("expiry" => 5));
sleep(6)
$cb->get('expires');
----

....
PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught exception 'CouchbaseException' with message 'LCB_KEY_ENOENT: The key does not exist on the server' in [CouchbaseNative]/CouchbaseBucket.class.php:196
Stack trace:
#0 [CouchbaseNative]/CouchbaseBucket.class.php(196): _CouchbaseBucket->get('expires', Array)
#1 /private/tmp/dummy.php(7): CouchbaseBucket->get('expires')
#2 {main}
  thrown in [CouchbaseNative]/CouchbaseBucket.class.php on line 196
....

Document expiration can also be set using the [.api]`upsert` family of methods which accept an optional [.param]`expiry` key in their options arrays.

[#batching]
== Batching Operations

xref:batching-operations.adoc[Bulk operations] may help you perform operations more efficiently and quicker by optimizing how commands are sent on the network.

Bulk operations may be performed by passing an array as the first argument to one of the [.api]`get()`, [.api]`upsert()`, [.api]`insert()`, [.api]`replace()` and other key-value methods.

When these methods are passed an array as input, they return an array as output, with the array containing document IDs as its keys and their respective [.api]`CouchbaseMetaDoc` objects as values.

This method works identically to its singular counterpart but instead accepts an array of keys to retrieve and returns an object where the object key matches your document ID and the object value is the result that you would normally expect to see from a singular operation.

For the [.api]`upsert()` family of methods, the top-level array value is a container for _options_.
The most important option is [.param]`value` which contains the actual value to be used as the document.

The following example shows how to insert and retrieve multiple documents.
The structure of each document is:

[source,json]
----
{
    "email": <....>
}
----

.Storing multiple documents
[source,php]
----
$results = $bucket->upsert(array(
    'foo' => array('value' => array('email' => 'foo@foo.com')),
    'bar' => array('value' => array('email' => 'bar@bar.com')),
    'baz' => array('value' => array('email' => 'baz@baz.com'))
    ));
foreach ($results as $docid => $metadoc) {
    echo("$docid => $metadoc->cas\n");
}
----

.Output
....
foo => 2gywu3yq6s
bar => 2hcxy0srv8
baz => 2hcxy0srv8
....

.Retrieving multiple documents
[source,php]
----
$results = $bucket->upsert(array("foo", "bar", "baz"));
    foreach ($results as $docid => $metadoc) {
    // Each document itself has a 'propname'
    echo "Result for $docid\n";
    var_dump($metadoc->value);
    echo "\n";
}
----

.Output
....
Result for foo
object(stdClass)#7 (1) {
  ["email"]=>
  string(11) "foo@foo.com"
}

Result for bar
object(stdClass)#9 (1) {
  ["email"]=>
  string(11) "bar@bar.com"
}

Result for baz
object(stdClass)#11 (1) {
  ["email"]=>
  string(11) "baz@baz.com"
}
....

== Atomic Operations

The PHP Couchbase SDK supports several operations that allow one-step, atomic changes to documents.
These operations include [.api]`counter`, [.api]`prepend`, and [.api]`append` functions.

The [.api]`counter()` method enables you to use an xref:core-operations.adoc#devguide_kvcore_counter_generic[atomic counter].
The first argument is the document ID, and the second argument is the _delta_ indicating by what amount the counter should be changed.
You may also pass an array of options as the third argument:

* [.param]`initial`: Initialize the counter to this value if the counter does not yet exist
* [.param]`expiry`: Set the xref:core-operations.adoc#expiry[document expiration] time
* [.param]`persist_to`, [.param]`replicate_to`: Specify xref:durability.adoc[durability requirements]

[source,php]
----
$result = $bucket->counter('counterId', 50, array('initial' => 100));
echo 'Current counter value is ' . $result->value . "\n";
----

xref:core-operations.adoc#devguide_kvcore_append_prepend_generic[Atomic byte concatenations] can be performed using the [.api]`append()` and [.api]`prepend()` methods.
These operations are potentially destructive.
Refer to the API documentation for more information.

== Operating with sub-documents

TIP: Sub-Document API is available starting Couchbase Server version 4.5.
See xref:subdocument-operations.adoc[Sub-Document Operations] for an overview.

Sub-document operations save network bandwidth by allowing you to specify _paths_ of a document to be retrieved or updated.
The document is parsed on the server and only the relevant sections (indicated by _paths_) are transferred between client and server.
You can execute xref:subdocument-operations.adoc[sub-document] operations in the PHP SDK using the [.api]`retrieveIn`, [.api]`lookupIn`, and [.api]`mutateIn` methods.

Each of these methods accepts an [.param]`id` as its mandatory first argument and return builders [.api]`CouchbaseLookupInBuilder` and [.api]`CouchbaseMutateInBuilder`

The builders have API to accumulate _command specifications_ and run the full pipeline by the [.api]`execute()` call.

[source,php]
----
$res = $bucket->lookupIn('docid')
              ->get('path.to.get')
              ->exists('check.path.exists')
              ->execute();

$res = $bucket->mutateIn('docid')
              ->upsert('path.to.upsert', $value, true)
              ->remove('path.to.del')
              ->execute();
----

For simply retrieving a list of paths, you may use the [.api]`retrieveIn` convenience method:

[source,php]
----
$res = $bucket->retrieveIn('docid', 'path1', 'path2', 'path3')
----

All sub-document operations return a special [.api]`CouchbaseDocumentFragment` object.
In contrast with a normal [.api]`CouchbaseMetaDoc` object, a [.api]`CouchbaseDocumentFragment` object contains multiple results with multiple statuses, one result/status pair for every input operation.
You can access an individual result/status pair by addressing the [.var]`value` of [.api]`CouchbaseDocumentFragment` object as a mapping, and then using index position of the operation as the key:

[source,php]
----
$res = $bucket->lookupIn('docid')
              ->get('foo')
              ->exists('bar')
              ->exists('baz')
              ->execute();

# First result
$res->value[0]
----

== Non-JSON Documents and Transcoders

TIP: See xref:nonjson.adoc[Non-JSON Documents] for a general overview of using non-JSON documents with Couchbase

All PHP objects which can be represented as JSON may be passed unmodified to a storage function, and be received via the get method without any additional modifications, with only note that by default JSON encoder configured to produce [.api]`stdClass` instances instead of arrays.
This behavior can be changed by modifying [.api]`$COUCHBASE_DEFAULT_DECOPTS`:

[source,php]
----
echo("default JSON decoder options: ");
var_dump($COUCHBASE_DEFAULT_DECOPTS);

$res = $bucket->get('foo');
var_dump($res->value);

echo("setting 'jsonassoc' to true\n");
$COUCHBASE_DEFAULT_DECOPTS['jsonassoc'] = true;

$res = $bucket->get('foo');
var_dump($res->value);
----

Output:

....
default JSON decoder options: array(1) {
  ["jsonassoc"]=>
  bool(false)
}
object(stdClass)#4 (1) {
  ["email"]=>
  string(11) "foo@foo.com"
}
setting 'jsonassoc' to true
array(1) {
  ["email"]=>
  string(11) "foo@foo.com"
}
....

You can modify the default JSON encoders used by the PHP SDK using the [.api]`setTranscoders` function.
This function accepts a pair of encode and decode functions which are expected transform the raw document depending on the document flags.

The following is an example of a transcoder which will unconditionally transcode all documents as UTF-8 encoded JSON documents.

[source,php]
----
$bucket->setTranscoders(
  function($value) {
    return array(json_encode($value), 0, 0);
  },
  function($value, $flags, $datatype) {
    return json_decode($value, true);
  }
);
----

[TIP]
====
To make migration from 1.x SDK easier, use the JSON serializer.
You may do this with settings in `php.ini`:

[source,ini]
----
; make sure that the JSON extension is loaded before couchbase
extension=json.so
extension=couchbase.so
; select default serializer
couchbase.serializer = json
----

Also, the serializer may be selected programmatically:

[source,php]
----
$bucket = new Couchbase("localhost:8091", "", "", "default");
$bucket->setOption(COUCHBASE::OPT_SERIALIZER, COUCHBASE::SERIALIZER_JSON);
----
