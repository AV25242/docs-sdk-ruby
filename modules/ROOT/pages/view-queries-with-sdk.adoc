== Querying Views from the PHP SDK

Once you have a view defined, it can be queried from the PHP SDK by using the [.api]`query(CouchbaseViewQuery $query)` method on the CouchbaseBucket class.
Here is an example:

.Querying simply MapReduce view
[source,php]
----
$query = CouchbaseViewQuery::from("landmarks", "by_name")->limit(10);
$landmarks = $bucket->query($query);
foreach ($landmarks->rows as $landmark)
{
    printf("%s\n", $landmark->key);
}
----

The [.api]`CouchbaseBucket.query` method takes an instance of CouchbaseViewQuery, executes it and returns back the result of query as either [.api]`stdClass` instance (which is default) or nested array depending on third argument [.api]`$json_asarray`.
Some useful methods and properties of the [.api]`CouchbaseViewQuery` class include (others can be seen in the reference documentation):

* [.api]`order`: set order of documents in result, accepts [.api]`CouchbaseViewQuery::ORDER_ASCENDING` or [.api]`CouchbaseViewQuery::ORDER_DESCENDING`
* [.api]`skip`: skip this number of records before starting to return the results
* [.api]`limit`: limit the number of the returned documents to the specified number
* [.api]`key`: return only documents that match the specified key.
* [.api]`keys`: return only documents that match one of keys specified within the given array

The value returned by [.api]``query``implementation that contains the results of the query and number of rows.
Depending on [.api]`$json_asarray` they should be accessed with property (default) or array syntax.

* [.api]`rows`: the results of the query.
* [.api]`total_rows`: the total count of all rows.

The entry of [.api]`rows` collection represents each row returned by the view request and contains properties for the document [.api]`id`, the [.api]`key` and the [.api]`value` if it was emitted.
Here is another example of a more advanced query:

.Querying a MapReduce view
[source,php]
----
$query = CouchbaseViewQuery::from("landmarks", "by_name")
    ->limit(10)->range("A", "\u0fff");
$landmarks = $bucket->query($query);
foreach ($landmarks->rows as $landmark)
{
    printf("%s\n", $landmark->key);
}
----

Here's some sample output for the previous query:

....
A R M Chicken
A. Cavalli &
A16
Abacus Books
Abbey and Palace of Holyroodhouse
Abbey Grounds
Abbot Kinney
Abbots Tandoori
ABC Bakery Cafe
Aberconwy House
....

== Querying Geospatial Views

To query a geospatial view, you will need to construct a [.api]`CouchbaseViewQuery` object using [.api]`fromSpatial` factory method.
Spatial queries accept additional builder method [.param]`bbox` which allow you to limit the enclosing bounding boxes of the result.
The argument to this method is and array of four [.api]``double``'s with each element corresponding to a component emitted by the key (longitude and latitude).

On output, spatial queries yield objects similar to how regular view query does, with an added `Geometry` property.

.Advanced querying a spatial view
[source,php]
----
$query = CouchbaseViewQuery::fromSpatial("spatial", "routes")
       ->limit(10)->bbox(array(0, -90, 180, 90));
$routes = $bucket->query($query);
foreach ($routes->rows as $route)
{
    var_dump($route->value);
}
----

The output:

....
array(3) {
  [0]=>
  string(5) "US964"
  [1]=>
  string(3) "DCA"
  [2]=>
  string(3) "CRW"
}
array(3) {
  [0]=>
  string(5) "DL790"
  [1]=>
  string(3) "MSP"
  [2]=>
  string(3) "CLE"
}
...
....

In the example above, we construct a [.api]`CouchbaseViewQuery` that will target the "routes" view on the "spatial" design document.

.Definition of spatial/routes view
[source,javascript]
----
/*
  Emit all the flights. You can filter them by day and time.
*/
function(doc, meta) {
    if (doc.type === 'route') {
        for (var i = 0; i < doc.schedule.length; i++) {
            var schedule = doc.schedule[i];
            var time = parseInt(schedule.utc.replace(/:/g, ''));
            var key = [schedule.day, time];
            var value = [
                schedule.flight,
                doc.sourceairport,
                doc.destinationairport
            ];
            emit(key, value);
        }
    }
}
----

We then pass the start and end coordinates in via the [.api]`bbox` method and finally we limit are results to 10 items with the [.api]`limit` method.
