[abstract]
The Couchbase Ruby SDK allows you to connect to a Couchbase cluster from Ruby.
The Couchbase Ruby SDK is a native Ruby extension and uses the Couchbase high-performance C library to handle communicating to the cluster over Couchbase binary protocols.


The Couchbase Ruby SDK 3.0 is a complete rewrite of the API, reducing the number of overloads to present a simplified surface area, and adding support for future Couchbase Server features like Collections and Scopes (available in Couchbase Server 6.5 as a xref:concept-docs:collections.adoc[developer preview]).

The Couchbase Ruby SDK is compatible with Ruby ???.

// tag::install[]

== Installing the SDK

Before installing the Ruby SDK, you must install the xref:3.0@c-sdk:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[C SDK -- _libcouchbase_ (LCB)];
version 3.0 or higher is required from PHP Client 3.0.

After installing the C SDK, install the Ruby SDK through????:

[source,bash]
----
$ pecl install https://packages.couchbase.com/clients/php/couchbase-3.0.0.tgz
----

Further details can be found on the xref:project-docs:sdk-release-notes.adoc[Release Notes & Archives page].

// installation and post-installation across platforms

// end::install[]

== Hello Couchbase

Couchbase uses xref:6.5@server:learn:security/roles.adoc[Role Based Access Control (RBAC)] to control access to resources.
Here we will use the _Full Admin_ role created during installation of the Couchbase Data Platform.
For production client code, you will want to use xref:howtos:managing-connections.adoc#rbac[more appropriate, restrictive settings], but here we want to get you up and running quickly.
If you're developing client code on the same VM or machine as the Couchbase Server, your URI can be _localhost_.


// initialize cluster

[source,php]
----
$connectionString = "couchbase://localhost";
$options = new \Couchbase\ClusterOptions();
$options->credentials("Administrator", "password");
$cluster = new \Couchbase\Cluster($connectionString, $options);
----

The `Cluster` provides access to cluster-level operations like N1Ql queries, analytics, or full-text search.
You will also find different management APIs on it.

To access the KV (Key/Value) API or to query views, you need to open a `Bucket`:

[source,php]
----
// get a bucket reference
$bucket = $cluster->bucket("bucket-name");
----

If you installed the travel sample data bucket, substitute _travel-sample_ for _bucket-name_.

[source,php]
----
// get a collection reference
$collection = $bucket->defaultCollection();

// or for named collection
$collection = $bucket->scope("myapp")->collection("my-collection");
----

The 3.0 SDK is ready for the introduction of xref:6.5@server:developer-preview:collections/collections-overview.adoc[Collections] in an upcoming release of the Couchbase Data Platform.
Couchbase Server 6.5 brings a limited xref:6.5@server:developer-preview:preview-mode.adoc[Developer Preview] of Collections, allowing Documents to be grouped by purpose or theme, according to a specified _Collection_. 
Here we've used the `DefaultCollection`, which provides the same functionality as bucket-level operations did in previous versions of Couchbase Server.

[source,php]
----
// upsert document
$upsertResult = $collection->upsert("my-document", ["name" => "mike"]);

// get document
$getResult = $collection->get("my-document");
----

KV Operations are described in detail on the xref:howtos:kv-operations.adoc[KV Operations page].
Now that you know the basics, you may wish to go straight to that page -- or first see a complete worked example of
using the Couchbase php client, our xref:hello-world:sample-application.adoc[Travel Sample Application].

== Additional Resources

// The API reference is generated for each release and can be found http://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-ruby-client-3.0.0/[here].
Older API references are linked from their respective sections in the xref:project-docs:sdk-release-notes.adoc[Release Notes].

xref:project-docs:migrating-sdk-code-to-3.n.adoc[The Migrating from SDK2 to 3 page] highlights the main differences to be aware of when migrating your code.
